# CPS353-Project

 # Description
 This project's goal will be to find the number of iterations in order to prove a number is not a lychrel number. A Lychrel number is a natural number that cannot form a palindrome through the iterative process of repeatedly reversing its digits and adding the resulting numbers.
 This program will have a limit of 60 iterations in order to prove that it is in fact a lychrel number.
